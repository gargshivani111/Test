# The group name or id of this consumer group. This group id is used to keep track of
# messages consumed by this consumer. If you have multiple consumers having the same
# group.id and are subscribed to same topic, then only one of the consumers will receive
# the message. Make sure to have a different group.id for different consumers subscribing
# to same topic so that all the consumers will receive the same message in parallel.

# What to do when there is no initial offset committed in Axon. This decides from where to start
# consumption of messages when you are the new consumer - from beginning? or from latest?
# 
# Options are,
#	earliest: automatically reset the offset to the earliest offset
#	latest: automatically reset the offset to the latest offset
#	none: throw exception to the consumer if no previous offset is found for the consumer's group
#	anything else: throw exception to the consumer.

# This setting controls how many records are pulled from Axon Server by the Consumer. SDK internally uses this to fetch these
# many records from Axon server every time a receiveMessages() is called or by an internal thread within SDK that calls MessageListener.onMessage().
#
# This setting ensures fair consumption across all the partitions and limits failures within the consumer code to only those records.
# If the consumer client want to limit the application processing logic failures to a small number, they should configure max.poll.records
# to be small.
# If this setting is not set, the default value is 2147483647 (Integer.MAX_VALUE)
#max.poll.records=500
