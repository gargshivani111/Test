# Batching of messages per partition (in bytes) to be sent to Axon server. A small batch size will make
# batching less common and may reduce throughput (a batch size of zero will disable batching entirely).
# A very large batch size may use memory a bit more wastefully as we will always allocate a buffer of
# the specified batch size in anticipation of additional records.
batch.size=40000

# Controls the maximum amount of time the SDK will wait for the response of a request. If the response
# is not received before the timeout elapses, the SDK will resend the request if necessary or fail the
# request if retries are exhausted.
request.timeout.ms=90000

# Setting a value greater than zero will cause the SDK to resend any record whose send fails with a
# potentially transient error. This retry is no different than if the producer client resent the record
# upon receiving the error.
# Note that allowing retries will potentially change the ordering of records because if two records are
# sent to a single partition, and the first fails and is retried but the second succeeds, then the second
# record may appear first.
